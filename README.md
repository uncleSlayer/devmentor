This is ai based chat application where the user can ask questions related to python programming, or programming in general and the bot will answer the question.
I've used the following technologies to make this application -
1. langchain for ai chat feature
2. fastapi for back end server
3. postgres database to save information of the user and conversations
4. supabase vector store to store embeddings of a python programming book pdf
5. next js for front end application
6. zustand for global state management
